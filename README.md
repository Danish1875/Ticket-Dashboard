# üìù Ticket Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a mini project management dashboard, inspired by tools like Trello and Atlassian, designed to manage projects and track tickets efficiently. It features real-time updates , email-based authentication, and a powerful super-user toggle for enhanced control and visibility.

## Key Features

The application is built to fulfill the following core requirements:

**Email-Based Authentication:** Secure, passwordless login using a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to the user's email. Successful login grants access to the ticket dashboard page.
**Projects & Tickets:** The dashboard lists all projects. Users can create a new project if none exist. Each project can have multiple tickets with descriptions.
**Real-time Updates:** Ticket movements must instantly reflect for other viewing users.
**Super-User Controls:** A password-protected toggle allows authorized users to display (ON) who created/updated tickets, or hide (OFF) this user info.
    **Activity Feed:** All ticket updates are shown instantly in the notifications for active users.
    **Email Alerts:** Updates are sent via email to team members who visited earlier but are currently offline.
